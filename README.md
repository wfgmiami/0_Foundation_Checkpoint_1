## Foundations Checkpoint 1

### Complete the specs

1. Before completing each spec, read the README.md File located in each folder and check the point value for each problem so you know how to prioritize each problem.
2. Write your code in each `solution_*.js` file so that you can pass the specs in located in the `*_specs.js` files
3. Run the test specs to test your code. To run the specs for a directory, you need to go into that directory and run the command `testem`.

```
$ cd foundations-checkpoint-1
$ testem
TEST'EM 'SCRIPTS!
